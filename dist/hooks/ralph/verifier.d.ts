/**
 * Ralph Verifier
 *
 * Adds architect verification to ralph completion claims.
 * When ralph claims completion, an architect verification phase is triggered.
 *
 * Flow:
 * 1. Ralph claims task is complete
 * 2. System enters verification mode
 * 3. Architect agent is invoked to verify the work
 * 4. If architect approves -> truly complete, use /oh-my-gemini:cancel to exit
 * 5. If architect finds flaws -> continue ralph with architect feedback
